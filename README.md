## What have you succeeded with so far.
I have succeeded with creating an early version of a web scraper. As of today it collects xml data from a website spesifically made for xml export (the only thing on the website is xml data https://www.w3schools.com/xml/cd_catalog.xml). Before this assignment I had no earlier experience nor information about web scrapers, but now I feel like I am getting a better understanding regarding how the tool works and how to implement it.

## What is currently challenging in the project
Here are some bullet points on what I find currently find challenging in the project:
- There are some issues regarding stack and cabal in the project, making it dificult to run the program (this is most likely on my side and what base version I have installed on my computer).
- Difficult to implement State monad in a good manner (wrote in project proposal that I would use this monad)
- Some difficulty making the program generic (currently fetching data from a specific website, but I want the user to be able to choose which website to collect data from).

## Note
There are some issues when trying to run the program due to stack and/or cabal issues (version errors)
